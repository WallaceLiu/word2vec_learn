word2vec for Lucene
===============

"word2vec for Lucene" extracts word vectors from Lucene index.

# strength and weakness
## strength
* You don't need to provide a text file besides Lucene index.
* You don't need to normalize text. Normalization has already been done in the index or Analyzer does it for you when processing.
* You can use a part of index rather than the whole of it by specifying a filter query.

## weakness (known limitations)
* You need to provide a Lucene index as a text corpus.
* You need to set field to be processed. The field must be indexed and stored.
* The optimized index is preferable than unoptimiaed one because we use [totalTermFreq](http://lucene.apache.org/core/4_10_2/core/org/apache/lucene/index/TermsEnum.html#totalTermFreq\(\) "totalTermFreq")() to get term count for each word.


# HOW TO USE

In this section, you'll know how to use demo environment provided in this project.

## prepare Apache Solr

Download Apache Solr 4.10.2 (recommended) and unzip the downloaded file in an appropriate directory. Go to example directory and launch Solr with solr.solr.home and solr.dir properties.

    $ cd solr-4.10.2/example
    $ java -Dsolr.solr.home=${word2vec-lucene}/solrhome -Dsolr.dir=${solr-inst-dir} -jar start.jar

## for people who like text8
### prepare text8.xml file
Execute ant to prepare sample input text8.xml file.

    $ ant t8-solr
    
This takes several minutes.

### index text8.xml into Solr
Index text8.xml file to Solr.

    $ ./post.sh collection1 text8.xml

### create vectors.txt file
Once you got Lucene index, you can now create vectors.txt file.

    $ ./demo-word2vec.sh collection1

With -f option, you can specify arbitrary output vectors file.

    $ ./demo-word2vec.sh collection1 -f vectors_my.txt

## for people who has PDF file
If you have Lucene in Action book PDF file, post the file to Solr.

    $ ./solrcell.sh LuceneInAction.pdf

## for people who prefer Japanese text
### prepare livedoor news corpus
Download livedoor news corpus from RONDHUIT site and unzip it in an appropriate directory.

    $ cd ${word2vec-lucene}
    $ mkdir work
    $ cd work
    $ wget http://www.rondhuit.com/download/livedoor-news-data.tar.gz
    $ tar xvzf livedoor-news-data.tar.gz
    $ cd ..

### index livedoor news corpus into Solr
Index livedoor news corpus xml files to Solr.

    $ ./post.sh ldcc work/*.xml

### create vectors.txt file
Once you got Lucene index, you can now create vectors.txt file.

    $ ./demo-word2vec.sh ldcc -a org.apache.lucene.analysis.ja.JapaneseAnalyzer

With -f option, you can specify arbitrary output vectors file.

    $ ./demo-word2vec.sh ldcc -a org.apache.lucene.analysis.ja.JapaneseAnalyzer -f vectors_my.txt

## compute distance among word vectors
Once you got word vectors file vectors.txt, you can find top 40 words that are closest words to the word you specified.

With -f option, you can specify arbitrary input vectors file.

    $ ./demo-distance.sh [-f <vectors_file>]
    cat
    Word: cat
    Position in vocabulary: 2601

                                                  Word      Cosine distance
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   rat          0.591972
                                                  cats          0.587605
                                                 hyena          0.583455
                                              squirrel          0.580696
                                                  dogs          0.568277
                                                   dog          0.556022


Or, you can compute vector operations e.g. vector('paris') - vector('france') + vector('italy') or vector('king') - vector('man') + vector('woman')

With -f option, you can specify arbitrary input vectors file.

    $ ./demo-analogy.sh [-f <vectors_file>]
    france paris italy
    man king woman

# Using text files rather than Lucene index
This tool supports not only Lucene index but also text files. See TextFileCreateVectors.java for details. The words in the text file must be separated by white space. This is normal for English and you need nothing for pretreatment. But for some languages e.g. Japanese, you need to "tokenize" the Japanese sentences into space-separated words before executing TextFileCreateVectors.java.
